# What it does: installs a small webhook receiver (packages/matrix-hook/hs-matrix-hook.py and
# matrix-card/) into the container "synapse" as the service hs-matrix-hook, creates the Matrix
# user hs-bot and writes the secret address to /var/lib/hs/matrix-hook. Radarr, Sonarr and Seerr
# send a Webhook to http://<synapse>:<port>/hook/<secret>/<room>; the room (default "media") is
# made on first use and the owner is invited. Every event becomes a notification card (a 1800x600
# PNG drawn with Pillow, fonts included in matrix-card/fonts; the poster is fetched from the
# payload's address); without Pillow, or if a card fails, a markdown message is sent instead.
# The owner types commands (help, clear, status, test, mute: matrix-card/bot.py) in a chat of their own with the
# bot ("Homeserver bot", made at the start, an unencrypted direct chat); the message rooms are read-only for the owner.
# Rooms are not encrypted (a bot without E2EE). Never a Zoraxy rule.
